You will find the PyCity Schools starter jupyter notebook in the GitHub repository.

A few observations from this data set:

Charter schools appear to have a much stronger positive outcome for overall learning. Students who attend charter schools consistently outperform students who attend district schools in both math and reading. 

Larger schools tend to have worse outcomes compared to small and medium size schools. While the data set is limited, we could imagine that the schools that have larger students have larger class rooms which may contribute to the lower outcomes. Schools with smaller students probably have smaller student:teacher ratios which translates to more focus per student which usally leads to better outcomes. 

Overall budget does not translate to better outcomes for students. In fact, schools that have larger budgets appear to have some of the worst outcomes. This doesn't conclude more money is bad for the students. It appears as though the larger the school, the higher the budget, at least for District schools but that doesn't tranlstae to better math, reading, or overall passing percentages.
